# RetroAchievements-Discord-Presence

I made this script because I found no simple way to have my RetroAchievements rich presence tracked on discord's rich Presence
A tutorial will follow up, with hopefully some QoL to make it even easier for users to use this script.

## Requirements

- Python3
- requests (https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- pypresence (https://pypi.org/project/pypresence/)
- Discord Application (for the discord client ID)

## Running the script

The first argument of your python call should be your Username, then your API_KEY, then your Discord Application Client ID
- Format: *python RANes.py [Username] [API_KEY] [DISCORD_CLIENT_ID]*
- Example: *python RANes.py AverageUser 0X0X0X0X0X0X0X0X 123456789*
